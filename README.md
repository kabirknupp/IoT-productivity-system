# IoT-productivity-system
A system that can be installed to help you be more productive.   Python code predicts the importance of my e-mails and logs real-time incoming Outlook messages to a Google sheets database.  An ESP32 microcontroller hooked up to a sound sensor measures the fluctuations of sound (people's chit chat and the  clicking of pens etc) in the surrounding environment and also logs this to a Google sheets database.  Finally, you can log your tasks on a very basic web app. You enter the difficulty of a task and start the timer, and stop it when you're done. This productivity data then goes to (you guessed it ðŸ˜‰ ) Google sheets!
